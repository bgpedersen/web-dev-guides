I created this web guide, to be able fast and easily to dump all tips, tricks and solutions to common problems I come across. I often find myself spending time finding the same solutions to the same problems - because we are all humans, and nobody can remember everything.

Hence the idea for this guide. Freeing up my mind so I can focus on developing, while gathering better and better solutions I can lookup when required.

I update this guide on a regular basis, when i come across better or new solutions.

Enjoy :smile:
